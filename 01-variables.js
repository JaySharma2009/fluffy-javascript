var fullname ="jay sharma";
var courseName ="learn javascript with me";

// how can you name a variable
// 1. camelCase   for ex:- fullName        -- most popular in javascript as well as best pratices
// 2. kebab-case  for ex:- full-name       -- not popular  can be used
// 3. snake_case  for ex:- full_name       -- not popular   can also be used
// 4. PascalCase  for ex:- FullName        -- not popular can also be used BUT WORST PRATICES


const NAME = "jay sharma";   // const is used for constant value IT CAN NOT BE CHANGED
// NAME = "jay sharma";      // this will give error

let firstname = "Jay";       // let is used for variable value IT CAN BE CHANGED its the morden for of var 

console.table({fullname,courseName,NAME,firstname});  // console.table is used to print the value in table format

console.log("fullname is: ",fullname);   // console.log is used to print the value in console 



// var contain so many problem so we use let and const instead of var
